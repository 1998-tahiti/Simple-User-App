# Simple-User-App
This App is used to get user information from local host and save or update data in MySQL database.
I have used wampserver3.2.6_x64 to create the database.
NetBeans IDE 8.2 has been used to create the Java file.
In order to run the whole app, connect any MySQL connector (I have used mysql-connector-java-8.0.28) in NetBeans or any Java IDE, then create a simple database and a table named UserInfo, then save the Java file and press "RESTful Test services" in order to get local host domain. Copy and paste the domain in any browser and input according parameters. Then run the Java file and return to Wamp server to see the updates in the database. The updates will also declare some messages in the browser.
